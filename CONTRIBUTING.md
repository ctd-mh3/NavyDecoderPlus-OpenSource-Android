# Contributing to Navy Decoder

There are two general areas to contribute to this project.

## Updates to the Source Data
* If you find specific errors in the data, let the project know.
* If you have access to the raw non-CUI RESFOR files (i.e., you are a SELRES), let the project know to allow for the most efficient way to update the application.

## Application code or other technical support
* If you are a technical type and want to provide application updates, please do.
* If you are good with graphics, the project can certainly use some more professional looking Google Play store images and other improvements.
